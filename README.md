# 📊 Web Traffic Data Analysis

An experimental project to define a scoring system for analyzing web article performance using statistical methods. - This project is inspired by research in digital content optimization. Specifically, what insights can we find in analyzing content that could then be used to maximize the value of future content relative to the effort of creating it?

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains analysis of web traffic data to understand what makes articles successful. Using various metrics and machine learning approaches, I identify key features that contribute to article performance and engagement.

## 🔑 Key Findings

My analysis revealed several crucial factors that contribute to article success:

### Top Performance Indicators
- 📈 Social shares are the strongest predictor of article success
- 🔗 External links (references) significantly impact article quality
- 🖼️ Multimedia content (images, videos) enhances engagement
- 📝 Longer, more comprehensive articles tend to perform better
- 😊 Positive sentiment correlates with better performance

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn/Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📈 Features Analyzed

- Engagement metrics (shares, comments)
- Content structure (length, links, multimedia)
- Sentiment analysis
- Writing complexity

## 📊 Data Analysis

The project includes:
- Feature importance analysis
- Performance correlation studies
- Content quality scoring
- Visualization of key metrics
